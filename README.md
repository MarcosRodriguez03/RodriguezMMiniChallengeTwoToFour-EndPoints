-I made three different api endpoints with different functions.
each one consist of 3 different controllers, 3 different services, and 3 different interfaces
-peer review: Jayvon Khuth - I was able to run everything and get all the correct ouputs on both swagger and postman. Looking at the code everything looks simple. I also liked how he used the data type double instead of integers. Great job, there weren't any bugs.
